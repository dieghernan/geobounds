		We present the geoBoundaries Global Administrative Database (geoBoundaries):
		an online, open license resource of the geographic boundaries of political
		administrative divisions (i.e., state, county). Contrasted to other resources
		geoBoundaries (1) provides detailed information on the legal open license for
		every boundary in the repository, and (2) focuses on provisioning highly
		precise boundary data to support accurate, replicable scientific inquiry.
		Further, all data is released in a structured form, allowing for the
		integration of geoBoundaries with large-scale computational workflows. Our
		database has records for every country around the world, with up to 5 levels
		of administrative hierarchy. The database is accessible at
		http://www.geoboundaries.org, and a static version is archived on the Harvard
		Dataverse.
